<h3>Paying for your project</h3>
<br></br>
We charge for the design and development of websites at various stages. Before we start work, a 50% deposit of the total sum due is payable (the deposit). When the websites design is approved by you and the home page is completed, a further 25% is due (design payment). The final 25% is payable when the website is complete and ready to 'go-live' (final payment) Your website will only be switched to 'live' mode when it has been paid for, in full. The initial deposit payment is non-refundable after CO Design Solutions has committed resource or completed research and/or design work on the client's behalf.
CO Design Solutions Ltd will charge 1.9% fee for all payments made using a credit or debit card. This fee is charged due to the costs incurred by CO Design Solutions for receiving such payments by our service provider. If this is not acceptable to the client, we also accept BACS and cheques as alternative payment methods which will incur no payment fees. If paying by cheque, please understand that we will have to allow the cheque to clear the banking system before starting or continuing with your project.
CO Design Solutions Ltd own all design and code of the website until final payment has been received in full. On receipt of final payment full ownership of the site files are handed to the client, this includes all design, branding and code.
<br></br>
<h3>Communication</h3>
<br></br>
Email is our primary method of contact with regard to all communication for your websites design and development. We have website designers and developers working for us in various parts of the world, as well as here in the UK. Email is obviously the most efficient and cost-effective form of contact. If you have any problems with the design or development of your website that your developer is unable to resolve by email, you can contact our telephone support service during UK office hours on 0800 193 3389 to talk to our UK-based support team.
It is the client's responsibility to inform us by email of any change in email address so we always have valid contact details. We cannot be held liable in any way for problems relating to communication issues if we are not supplied with a valid email address. Some of our systems rely on this email to inform you of various important information. We also advise that clients check junk and spam folders regularly.
It is important for the client to keep in contact with CO Design Solutions Ltd throughout the entire project. If a client does not make contact for more than 2 weeks, we will make up to 5 attempts to contact the client by email using the email address for the client held on file. If we do not receive a response to these attempts of contact the project may be terminated, and the deposit will not be refunded. If the client wishes to postpone the project for a period of longer than 2 weeks, please contact us. Otherwise the project may be archived. We reserve the right to levy a £100 plus VAT administration fee if the client returns after an unapproved postponement where the time since last contact is less than 6 months and wishes to continue work on their project.
If a client returns from an unapproved postponement and the last contact is more than 6 months, we shall need to provide a new quotation for the project and your original deposit will be non-refundable or transferable. Any design or development work completed previously may no longer be available.
<br></br>
<h3>Website Design and Development</h3>
<br></br>
Design is subjective, and for this reason we offer 'unlimited design revisions'. This means that we will continue to work with you on your design concept until you are happy with our proposal. The unlimited design revision period ends when the client accepts the design proposal and home page draft. Design changes beyond this point are subject to additional charges.
Design and layout changes to the internal pages of the website are subject to restrictions within Wordpress, Magento, Opencart and Skadate developments.
CO Design Solutions Ltd will provide the client with an expected completion time frame for the project (live on the internet) if requested. CO Design Solutions Ltd will provide a client access to its 'Project Cycle' documentation to ensure a client is fully aware of the responsibilities they have to ensure a successful and timely development. In order to provide a completion date a final list of chnages is needed from the client.
Open Source software (OSS) is publically available software that may be adapted or modified to suit particular applications. OSS may be used to help develop elements of the functionality of the client's website to speed development and add functionality. Where Open Source software is used, the ownership of the site coding and any customisations made by the developer is still passed to the client upon final payment.
<br></br>
<h3>Hosting and Search Engine Optimisation</h3>
<br></br>
CO Design Solutions Ltd will host the website if the client requires us to do so and on receipt of full payment of our hosting fees. In doing so, CO Design Solutions Ltd will provide a reliable and professional service to the client at all times, excluding unavoidable technical failures. All standard hosting offered by CO Design Solutions Ltd is limited to 1Gb of website space unless otherwise stated in a separate contract.
<br></br>
CO Design Solutions hosting is annually renewable. The date of renewal will be 12 calendar months from the date the website was made live. CO Design Solutions will contact the client 6 weeks before the renewal date and hosting services are not obligated.

We reserve the right to deactivate any website when the hosting has expired and the client has not paid the renewal charge.

If the client does not wish to renew the hosting the site files and associated data can be made available to the client fee free on request and the domain name can be transferred to the client's registrar account. Should the client instruct us to upload and configure the site and domain name to a third party server this work will be subject to charge.
CO Design Solutions reserve the right to delete the website from our servers 3 months after the date your hosting expired if you choose to not renew the hosting.

<br></br>
If required, a domain name will be registered by CO Design Solutions Ltd on behalf of the client once we have received payment in full. These are limited to .co.uk and .com, any additional domain names can be purchased for and additional charge. Although the domain names are registered to us, the client is the legal owner of the domain and if they request to have details changed or the domain transferred elsewhere, we will do this within a reasonable timeframe.
Domain names require yearly renewal and there is an associated fee for this.

This is limited to .co.uk and .com domains, any other Top Level Domains will carry separate charges.
Any domain name renewal is the responsibility of the client. CO Design Solutions will attempt to contact the client by email up to 2 weeks in advance of a domain renewal being due. If the client doesn’t pay to renew their domain name, the domain name shall not be renewed. We advise that you contact us 50 weeks after you purchase or renew a domain if you wish to renew it for another year.
CO Design Solutions Ltd provides links or references to our client's websites solely for the convenience of prospective customers and intends that the links it provides be current and accurate, but does not guarantee or warrant that such links will point to the intended client site at all times.
We place a small text link on the footer of our client's website that simply states the website was designed by CO Design Solutions and links to our company website. This link can be removed, if required.
<br></br>
<h3>Website Text Copy (Content)</h3>
<br></br>
The client will be offered to utilise the CO Design Solutions ContentWriter package at an additional charge to the website. If the client doesn`t require this package, CO Design Solutions will require the client to send all content that is to be added to the website in a Microsoft Word doc file. This excludes products on an ecommerce site as these are to be added by the client once the site is complete. The website content must be received no later than 4 weeks after the design has been approved and signed off. If the client does not send content within this time period, CO Design Solutions reserve the right to send the design files to the client and collect full payment.
